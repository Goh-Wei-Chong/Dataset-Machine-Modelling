# Dataset Machine Modelling

## Introduction
## Assignment 1
I am getting a detailed exploration and analysis on my journey of understanding and data preparation on the given datasets, hr_data.csv: a document containing details of employee personal information; and listings.csv: a document containing the listing activity and metrics from year 2013 to 2019; based on the targets for each dataset. I will also be going through the interesting findings and new information I have learnt throughout this process and how it changes or improves my research in data preparation.

## Assignment 2
I am solving classification and regression problems using Machine Learning Models on the two data prepared datasets from the previous assignment, hr_data_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable is_promoted that gives a detailed information of the employees. As well as listings_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable price that shows previous reservation details and listing activities from 2013 to 2019, including hosts information from the central neighbourhood. I will also go through the interesting findings and new information I have learnt throughout this process and how it changes or improves my research in finding and creating the best model for both classification and regression.

## Technology Used
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
    - The project uses **Anaconda** to use Jupyter Notebook.

## Models Used
I used 6 different classification and regression models for their corresponding questions

Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Multi-Layered Perception(MLP) Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier(SVC)
- Extreme Gradient Boost(XGBoost) Classifier

Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Multi-Layered Perception(MLP) Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor(SVR)
- Extreme Gradient Boost(XGBoost) Regressor

### Acknowledgements
- I learned many of the model's hyperparameters for grid search from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
