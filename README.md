# Dataset Machine Modelling

## Introduction
### Assignment 1
I am getting a detailed exploration and analysis on my journey of understanding and data preparation on the given datasets, hr_data.csv: a document containing details of employee personal information; and listings.csv: a document containing the listing activity and metrics from year 2013 to 2019; based on the targets for each dataset. I will also be going through the interesting findings and new information I have learnt throughout this process and how it changes or improves my research in data preparation.

### Assignment 2
I am solving classification and regression problems using Machine Learning Models on the two data prepared datasets from the previous assignment, hr_data_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable is_promoted that gives a detailed information of the employees. As well as listings_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable price that shows previous reservation details and listing activities from 2013 to 2019, including hosts information from the central neighbourhood. I will also go through the interesting findings and new information I have learnt throughout this process and how it changes or improves my research in finding and creating the best model for both classification and regression.
