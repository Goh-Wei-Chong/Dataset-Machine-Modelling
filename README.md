# Dataset Machine Modelling

## Introduction
### I am solving classification and regression problems using Machine Learning Models on the two data prepared datasets from the previous assignment, hr_data_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable is_promoted that gives a detailed information of the employees. As well as listings_new.csv: a data prepared dataset catered to check the variable price that shows previous reservation details and listing activities from 2013 to 2019, including hosts information from the central neighbourhood. I will also go through the interesting findings and new information I have learnt throughout this process and how it changes or improves my research in finding and creating the best model for both classification and regression.
